## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words
Hockey is a huge part of my life and I think it would be very fun to try to compare todays NHL players to the players of the previous decade (2000's). There has been a huge debate on how todays players are more skilled and better but i'd like to compare statistics and see which is "better". I think specifically i will want to compare McDavid's career to Crosbys career from age 18-22. Both are considered to be generational talents so i think they will be my focus for the project.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words
My dataset was collected from the NHL and HockeyReference and contains every NHL player from 2004-2017 and their statistics. It contains many stats such as Goals, Assists, Points, the team, Plus Minus, ETC. The purpose of my dataset is to compare seasons from recent years to seasons of later years and how to compare to each other and see which year contributed the most amount of offenceive production in terms of Shots, Shooting Percentage, Assists, Assits per Game, Points per Game, Points, Goals and Goals per game! My data was collected from human collecting i believe since stats are updated daily depending on which games were played.
