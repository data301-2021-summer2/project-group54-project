## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words
Hockey is a huge part of my life and I think it would be very fun to try to compare todays NHL players to the players of the previous decade (2000's). There has been a huge debate on how todays players are more skilled and better but i'd like to compare statistics and see which is "better". I think specifically i will want to compare McDavid's career to Crosbys career from age 18-22. Both are considered to be generational talents so i think they will be my focus for the project.
